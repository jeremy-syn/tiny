# This benchmark suite is under construction. 

The TinyMLPerf benchmark suite consists four benchmarks:
|       Use Case       |                   Description                   |          Dataset          |       Model      |

There are two division:
* The closed division of the benchmark requires the use of a pre-trained model but allows submitters to use post training quantization and optimizations.
* The open division allows arbitrary selection of pre-processing and model architecture within an accuracy threshold. The open division allows for novel techniques, and a more diverse set of results at the cost of direct comparability.

The structure of the repository is as follows:
* The pre-trained models are found in [training](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master/v0.1/training) along with the dataset, training and quantization scripts.
* The benchmark API is defined in [API](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master/v0.1/api) which includes the required submitter implemented functions.
* All four benchmarks have a [reference submission](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master/v0.1/reference_submissions) which implement 
the benchmarks using [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) and Mbed on the [reference platform](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l4r5zi.html).

We follow the [MLPerf Inference Rules](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_policies/blob/master/inference_rules.adoc) unless there is a specific exception related to TinyMLPerf.
